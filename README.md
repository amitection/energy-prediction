# Energy Consumption Prediction

This is a sub-project of my dissertation responsible for responding to prediction requests from clients.

It uses [sklearn's](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) MLP module to train on simulated data generated from 
[Load Profile Generator](http://www.loadprofilegenerator.de/) simulator.

Most this source has been derived from [Azure's tutorial](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-EnergyDemandTimeSeriesForecasting).
